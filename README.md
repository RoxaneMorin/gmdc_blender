# gmdc_blender

Additions to the original plugin:
- Tool to add the custom params required for export to a mesh.
- Tool to copy a mesh's current split normals to its vertexcolor map, so that custom normals can be exported.

Known issues:
- Morphs are not being exported.
- Bounds are not properly generated for rigged meshes.
  (This was already the case inthe original version of the plugin.)
